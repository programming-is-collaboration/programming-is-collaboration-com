          <h1>Programming is Collaboration</h1>
          <p>
            The role and importance of <strong>collaboration</strong> in
            <strong>software</strong> and what it means for <strong>working with
            people</strong> — in pair programming, at the whiteboard, in chat and
            video, in code reviews, and in the very <strong>code</strong> we
            design, write, read, debug, and maintain.
